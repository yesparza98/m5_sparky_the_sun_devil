					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>I am the official mascot of Arizona State University. Originally the ASU athletic teams' mascot was an owl, then became a "Normal" (named for the Tempe Normal School), then was later changed to a bulldog. The State Press, the student newspaper, ran frequent appeals during the fall of 1946, urging the Bulldog to be replaced by the new Sun Devil. On November 8 of that year the student body voted 819 to 196 to make the change. On November 20, as reported by the Arizona Republic, the student council made it official. The following day, the first Arizona State team played as the Sun Devils. In 1948, an alumnus and Disney illustrator by the name of Bert Anthony designed Sparky, an imp with a trident (also described as a pitchfork).</p>
